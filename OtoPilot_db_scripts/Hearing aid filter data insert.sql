Manufactured by Phonak, a Sonova AG brand, the Lyric4 is engineered to reside entirely deep within the ear canal, leveraging the pinna and concha''s natural acoustics to provide a more authentic sound quality. This non-wireless model was CE 0459 marked in 2020 and meets FDA regulations for the US market, requiring a prescription for sale.

From a clinical perspective, the Lyric4 is indicated for hearing-impaired individuals seeking amplification and sound transmission to compensate for their hearing deficit. While primarily targeting the adult population, its application can extend to children over 36 months and teenagers, contingent upon suitable ear canal anatomy, a decision made collaboratively between the Lyric-trained hearing care professional (HCP), the user, and their caregiver. As an extended-wear device, it offers 24/7 use for prolonged periods—up to a maximum of 120 days or until its disposable battery is depleted—after which the unit is discarded. Battery longevity is influenced by factors such as time spent in SLEEP mode or OFF, exposure to noisy environments, and individual earwax production. A comprehensive warranty from Sonova AG covers manufacturing and material defects, explicitly excluding normal wear and tear, improper handling, chemical exposure, water immersion, undue stress, or services rendered by the HCP.

The Lyric4 notably diverges from contemporary hearing aid trends by lacking smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth capabilities, AI processing, automatic programs, bilateral connectivity, or stereo processing. Its functionality is controlled solely via the SoundLync, a specialized magnetized remote tool. This allows for precise adjustments: a single beep signals activation (ON), two beeps engage SLEEP mode (providing acoustic transparency by compensating for the hearing aid''s inherent damping), and a sequence of two followed by four beeps turns the device OFF (at which point it functions as an earplug). Volume adjustments are incrementally controlled, confirmed by a series of beeps, with a double beep indicating maximum amplification; the device retains the last selected volume setting upon subsequent activation.

Fitting the Lyric4 is a highly specialized procedure exclusively performed by a Lyric-trained HCP, as it requires precise placement within the deep ear canal.

Clinically, this system addresses two distinct manifestations of single-sided hearing loss:
1.  **CROS (Contralateral Routing of Signal) System:** Indicated for patients with profound or unaidable hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing sensitivity in the contralateral ear. In this configuration, a microphone situated on the side of the poorer-hearing ear captures sounds and speech. These signals are then wirelessly transmitted to a receiver unit worn on the healthy ear. The clinical benefit lies in restoring sound awareness and improving localization cues from the poorer-hearing side, effectively overcoming the head-shadow effect and enhancing speech understanding in noise originating from the unaidable side.
2.  **BICROS (Bilateral Contralateral Routing of Signal) System:** Designed for individuals with profound or unaidable hearing loss in one ear, coupled with a measurable hearing loss (ranging from mild to severe) in the contralateral "better" ear. Similar to the CROS system, a microphone on the unaidable ear captures sound. This audio is then transmitted to a hearing aid worn on the better-hearing ear, which not only amplifies the transmitted sound from the poorer side but also provides amplification specifically tailored to the hearing loss of the better ear. This dual-action approach allows for comprehensive sound access from both sides, with the amplification in the better ear personalized to the patient''s audiometric profile, yielding a more balanced and complete auditory experience.

While the system inherently involves two devices for its CROS/BICROS functionality, providing a form of bilateral input to the brain, the recommended fitting approach is versatile, catering to the specific needs of "unilateral scenarios" where the primary concern is single-sided deafness.

Findings validate its recommendation even for individuals with more mild degrees of hearing loss, expanding its candidacy beyond traditional moderate-to-severe losses.

**Fitting and Programming Considerations:**
As a custom-fit CIC, an accurate ear impression is requisite for optimal physical fit and acoustic coupling. A critical consideration for audiologists is the handling of telecoil functionality. Unlike some larger hearing aid styles, the Evolv AI wireless CIC does not feature an embedded telecoil. Instead, CIC users access hearing loop systems via the "T" mode of the 2.4 GHz Remote Microphone + accessory. This necessitates counseling patients on the accessory''s use for optimal benefit in looped environments. The importance of in-office demonstration of telecoil functionality cannot be overstated; research indicates that patients receiving a practical demonstration show significantly better recall and higher rates of self-initiated telecoil use compared to those who receive only verbal explanations. Clinicians should emphasize paired-comparison evaluations in realistic scenarios to improve perceived benefit and promote sustained utilization of assistive listening technologies.

**Limitations:**
The primary technical limitation for audiologists to consider is the absence of integrated directional microphones, as all CIC microphones within this model are omnidirectional. While wireless accessories effectively bridge this gap in specific challenging environments, patients relying solely on the hearing aid''s inherent microphone for complex listening situations might not achieve the same directivity benefits as devices with embedded directional arrays. Therefore, patient education regarding accessory dependence for optimal performance in noise and looped environments is crucial for successful outcomes.','Evolv AI',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,'CIC',NULL,'CIC',1,'Telecoil_20Feature_20Summary_20APR22_F.md');

Central to its implementation is the Beltone Solus Max™ fitting software, which allows for a foundational setup combined with intricate client-specific adjustments, streamlining the fitting process through adaptable default settings and experience levels.

A cornerstone technology available with Beltone Envision™ is the Microphone & Receiver-In-Ear (M&RIE) configuration, offering a uniquely natural sound experience. By placing a microphone within the ear canal, M&RIE leverages the individual''s unique ear and head anatomy, allowing the hearing aid to access sound in a way that preserves natural localization cues. This innovative design significantly enhances spatial orientation and the differentiation of sound sources. Furthermore, the M&RIE microphone''s protected placement within the outer ear reduces wind noise by up to 22 dB compared to traditional omnidirectional microphone transmission, a critical benefit for active users. Clinically, when fitting M&RIE, it''s important to note that the receiver is marginally larger than standard LP and MP receivers due to the integrated microphone, necessitating a more occluding earpiece for optimal performance. The Beltone Adaptive Fitting Algorithm (BAFA) is the recommended fitting rule for M&RIE, as it was specifically developed to complement this technology.

The BAFA fitting algorithm, the primary prescriptive approach within the Beltone Solus Max™ software, is predicated on the principle of loudness normalization. It applies frequency and input-level dependent amplification to ensure hearing aid users perceive narrowband signals with similar loudness dynamics to individuals with normal hearing. Recognizing user preferences for slightly less amplification, BAFA calculates 3 to 10 dB less insertion gain across frequencies and hearing losses compared to generic rules like NAL-NL2, which primarily targets speech intelligibility maximization.

For seamless clinical integration, Beltone Solus Max™ offers a suite of advanced tools. The Patient Profile screen facilitates customized initial fits based on previous hearing aid experience and tolerance for amplification, allowing audiologists to set desired fitting rules, experience levels, and gain percentages. Profiles range from "New to Sound" (prioritizing comfort with 70% of First Time User targets) to "Experienced" (for full prescriptive targets) and "Linear" (for previous linear amplification users). The software includes a Vent Correction view, simulating the vent effect of selected earpieces to guide appropriate earpiece selection for meeting gain targets, particularly in low frequencies. The Output View provides crucial insight into the Maximum Power Output (MPO) curve, enabling clinicians to adjust MPO or select a higher power receiver to prevent distortion and maximize dynamic range.

Feedback calibration is an indispensable step for every fitting, as it is an in-situ measurement that accounts for the unique acoustic parameters of the client''s ear and device, ensuring a feedback-free experience. This calibration is mandatory for devices fitted with the M&RIE receiver. Advanced features are logically organized within the software: the Speech tab optimizes access to speech, while the Comfort tab focuses on noise reduction and feedback management. Specialized features such as Tinnitus Breaker Pro (TBP) are also accessible. Default settings for these advanced features are intelligently guided by the client''s audiometric thresholds, feedback calibration results, hearing aid style, and selected experience level.

Practical considerations for fitting Beltone Envision™ include a straightforward connection process within Solus Max, with automatic receiver side, power, and length selection for Beltone SureFit 3 receivers.
